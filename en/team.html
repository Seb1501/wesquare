      	<p> Thomas has already lived 1000 lives.  He was established in the Emirates in the wellness sector before throwing himself headlong into the agro-food business in Africa.  His gift for business is like Obelix and the magic potion: he fell into the cauldron when he was a boy.</p>
      	<p>He’s the CEO of wesquare<sup>&reg;</sup> and his unique vision and energy are a boon all Parisians who are fed up with living in cramped conditions!
		<p>He likes: travelling, taking initiatives, street-art and green jelly beans.</p>

      	<hr>
      	<p>  Sébastien is the Dalaï Lama of wesquare<sup>&reg;</sup>: his calm, philosophical thinking is invaluable.  Formerly a consultant based in Luxemburg, he forms part of a generation of young businessmen who firmly intend to promote an attractive and dynamic image of their country.</p>
      	<p>At wesquare<sup>&reg;</sup> he’s in charge of technology and operations, where his incredible talent for reacting quickly and efficiently is invaluable.</p>
      	<p>He likes: making a difference, mountain-climbing, taking action and the smell of plasticine.</p>

      	<p> Camille, our business manager, is to wesquare® what Arnold Schwartzenegger always was to body-building: a force to be reckoned with.  He moved to the Emirates early on in his career to work with Thomas, then decided to come back to Paris to perform his magic on wesquare<sup>&reg;</sup>.</p> 
      	<p>He boasts Im91 of thoroughness and perseverance and 100k of devotion to your needs.</p>
